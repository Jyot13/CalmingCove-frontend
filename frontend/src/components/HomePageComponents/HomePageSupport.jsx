            <h2>Free emotional support for those moments when you just need somebody to talk to.</h2>
                <p>We’ve all been there. We’ve all had moments where we didn’t feel our best. Sometimes what we really need in these situations, is just somebody to talk to, - somebody who cares, somebody who won’t judge, and will listen without bias. This is not always possible to find in our own circles of family and friends. CalmingCove will connect you to trained active listeners - compassionate, caring volunteers who will listen, support, and be there for you. Our methods are peer-reviewed and evidence-backed.</p>
